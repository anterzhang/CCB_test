  3) Equivalent transform: heterogenous channels -> i.i.d. channel (symetric capacity region) -> M/GI/C queue;
  4) Original capacity region -> polymatroid (lower bound of the mean sojourn time; always max total service rate, no trade-off is necessary)
  Strengths: 1) Transform the problem into M/GI/C queue;
  2) optimal policy for the polymatroid (lower bound) is obtained;
  3) Performances for policies with file-size information (SRPT + HPR, SRPT + OPS) and without this information (OPS) are obtained and compared;

  Weaknesses:1) Rigorous analysis is only for transient system;
  2) No slow fading (mobility) is concerned;
  3) Minimize mean sojourn time; deadline is not concerned",
